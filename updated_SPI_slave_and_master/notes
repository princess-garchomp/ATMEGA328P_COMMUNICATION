the file SPI_make_it_work is the master application

the file UART_SPI_SLAVE is the slave applicatoin

I have RGBLEDS connected to each of the two arduino boards 
the two boards are connected via the SPI peripherals (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS of each board are connected)
the slave is also connected to my PC via the serial port and is being monitored using terminal application putty to visulaize the data that is send ober SPI
  the slave uses the UART to send data to putty
